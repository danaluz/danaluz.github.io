## Welcome to my GitHub Page

Hello there, welcome to my GitHub page. My name is Dana Luz G., and I'm currently living in Argentina. I am a Systems Engineer undergrad student. You can check out my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dana-luz-gonzalez) profile and keep in touch. Also, here is my [about.me](https://about.me/dana_gonzalez) page. 

#### Project Management

I'm also a [**Certified Project Manager**](http://ltgp.com.ar/certifications/Certificate_DanaLuz_PMI_CAM.pdf) and an active volunteer in the [**PMI Buenos Aires Chapter**](http://www.pmi.org.ar/noticiadetalle.php?id_noticia=916). 

#### IEEE Participation
I've been President of the IEEE Computer Society, where we create a [collaborative project](https://github.com/IEEESBUTNBA/IEEETalks) trying to use the latest Microsoft technologies. Drop by and collaborate!

#### Papers and Publications

You can find me on [researchgate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Dana_Gonzalez), where I keep uploading updates about publications and other projects.

### Machine Learning 

In my [**Page**](https://danaluz.github.io/AIAlgorithms/) you will find a guide through the algorithms in my repository, where there are code ready to run (if you have everything propering installed, if not, fear not, there are steps in each folder explaining it). This is still a work in progress and I keep updating the documentation, but if you have any doubts, feel free to contact me though any of my profiles.
