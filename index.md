## Welcome to my GitHub Page

Hello there, welcome to my GitHub page. My name is Dana Luz G., and I'm currently living in Argentina. You can check out my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dana-luz-gonzalez) profile and keep in touch. 
  
### About Me

I am a Systems Engineer undergrad student. 

I'm also a [**Certified Project Manager**](http://ltgp.com.ar/certifications/Certificate_DanaLuz_PMI_CAM.pdf) and an active volunteer in the [PMI Buenos Aires Chapter](http://www.pmi.org.ar/noticiadetalle.php?id_noticia=916). 

I've been President of the IEEE Computer Society, where we create a [colaborative project](https://github.com/IEEESBUTNBA/IEEETalks) trying to use the latest Microsoft technologies. This is poster I created to show our project!

Also, here is my [about.me](https://about.me/dana_gonzalez) page. 

### Machine Learning 

In my [**Page**](https://danaluz.github.io/AIAlgorithms/) you will find a guide through the algorithms in my repository, where there are code ready to run (if you have everything propering installed, if not, fear not, there are steps in each folder explaining it). This is still a work in progress and I keep updating the documentation, but if you have any doubts, feel free to contact me though any of my profiles.
