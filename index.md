## Welcome to my GitHub Page

Hello there, welcome to my GitHub page. My name is Dana Luz G., and I'm currently living in Argentina. You can check out my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dana-luz-gonzalez) profile and keep in touch. Also, here is my [about.me](https://about.me/dana_gonzalez) page. 

I am interested in Machine Learning algorithms, and I found several types of implementations across the web, that I tried and coded. 

Here are a few links you could try if you already have some foundation:

* [Simple Neural Network in Python](https://medium.com/technology-invention-and-more/how-to-build-a-simple-neural-network-in-9-lines-of-python-code-cc8f23647ca1#.w8syxd4fc).


* [Linear Regression](https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/879043/Implementing-Gradient-Descent-to-Solve-a-Linear-Re).


* [K-NN and the NBA](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/k-nearest-neighbors-in-python/)


And an even better place to start:

* [Coursera: Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/home)
  
### Machine Learning 

In my [**Repository**](https://github.com/danaluz/Machine-Learning-Algorithm-Implementations-Examples) you will find code ready to run of the links mentioned above. This is still a work in progress and I keep updating the documentation, but if you have any doubts, feel free to contact me though any of my profiles.

### Other Projects

You can find a [**C# .Net**](https://github.com/danaluz/DDS-TP) project also. This was for an University course. 

### More interests

Also, I'm learning about [**Geographic Information Systems**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographic_information_system), and the possibilities of Open Data.
